## ðŸ’» Usage

### Process Overview:
1. **Train LAVQ-Editor**: First, train the LAVQ-Editor using the above command. 
```
python train.py --model_name LAVQ_Editor --batch_size 128 
```
2. **Generate New ECG**: After training, generate new ECG data by the Gen_test() function in train.py. The generated ECG data is used to augment the training set for the classifier.

3. **Retrain Classifier**: Next, add generated ECG data to 'train_lis' of the train_dataset and retrain classifier by running:
```
python train_classifier.py
```
