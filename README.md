## ðŸ’» Usage
Before starting the training, a classifier is needed to monitor the training process.
However, the quality of this classifier is not important.
You can choose anyway to obtain the best_w.pth.
To train LAVQ-Editor, you can use the following code.
```
python train.py --model_name LAVQ_Editor --batch_size 128 
```
